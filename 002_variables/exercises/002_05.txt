for 

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

"puts x" prints 3 to the screen, without error.

for

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

assuming irb is quit entirely between running the two code blocks,
'undefined local variable or method' NameError is thrown. x is 
unavailable outside the do loop.

Ruby-Lang @ https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

If I must pick a favorite, I nominate Ruby-Lang: the collection of links and 
guides for Ruby learners is exhaustive (eight different books on learning and
working with Ruby alone!). It's a minimalistic, visually appealing, easily-
navigable website as well.

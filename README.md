#### github practice for ls100 ####
#### 16 jan 2019 ####

so this is practice for learning to use github. 
git's commands make me giggle, tbh. 'git?' 'fetch?' 'pull?'

there is a difference between 'fetch' and 'pull'. 
'fetch' downloads the repo file with changes only; 'pull' actually
downloads the changed files and merges them with existing local files.

bye!

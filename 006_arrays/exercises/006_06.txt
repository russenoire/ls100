names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

# a) names isn't a hash, so its indices can't be accessed or modified that way
# b) if the idea was to append 'jody' to names: names << 'jody' would work
  b after solution) oh! not clear that the intent was to substitute!
  so names[3] = 'jody'
